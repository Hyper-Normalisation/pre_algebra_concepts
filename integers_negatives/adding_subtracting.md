# Adding and Subtracting Equations and Reps #1

# Reminders and Notes:

- Always rewrite subtraction as addition. For example if the equation is: 45 - (-17) , that can be rewritten as: 45 + 17.
- For different signs, continue to repeat in my head, "subtract magnitudes, keep the bigger sign." An example would be: -15 + 22, which would end up being: 22 - 15 = 7, the bigger
magnitude is 22, so we keep it postive.


1. -12 + 20 = 8


2. 34 - (-16) = 50


3. -50 + 23 = -27


4. 18 - (-7) = 25

 
5. -9 + 15 = 6


6. 60 - (-25) = 85


7. -42 + 30 = -12


8. -100 - (-45) = -55


9. 75 + (-120) = -45


10. -8 - (-8) = 0
