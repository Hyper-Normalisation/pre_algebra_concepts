# Integers and Negatives Concept Breakdown

What are they?
- Integers: ...., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,.....
- Absolute Value: |x| is the distance from 0 (always non negative).
- Opposite/addictive inverse: the number that sums to 0 with x (eg. opposite of 7 is -7)

Addition and Subtraction:
-Same sign: add magnitudes, keep the sign (eg. -6 + -4 = -10).
- Different signs: subtract magnitudes, take the sign of the larger magnitude (eg. -12 + 7 = -5)
- Substraction is "add the opposite": a - b = a + (-b) (eg. 18 -(-5) = 18 + 5).


Multiplication and Division (sign rules):
- (+) x (+) = (+)
- (-) x (-) = (+)
- (+) x (-) = (-)
- (-) x (+) = (-)

Order of Operations:
- Parentheses -> Exponents -> Multiple/Divide -> Add/Subtract (left to right)
- PEMDAS
- Keep parentheses around negatives when substituting.

Distributive property (watch the signs!)
- a(b + c) = ab + ac
- a(b - c) = ab - ac
- -(b - c) = -b + c


Working Learning Examples:

1.) -12 + 7 
Answer = -5  (Why? Reason it is -5 is because when its adding or subtracting two different magnitudes, we subtract the
two magnitudes and then take the larger magnitudes sign.)


2.) 18 - (-5) - 20 + (-3)

18 - (-5) = 18 + 5 = 23 

23 - 20 = 3

3 + (-3)

Answer = 0

(Why? Reason, is becuase we start off with left to right and work our way through. It begins with 18 - (-5), which they
are the same sign so we add them together, and then keep the sign of the larger magnitude, which is 18 and its positive. Then
we take that total which is 23, and subtract that from 20, which gives us 3. Simple. Then after that we take 3 + (-3), and
cause one is positive and one is negative we subtract them together and get a total of 0.
