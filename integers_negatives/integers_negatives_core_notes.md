# Integers and Negatives Concept Breakdown

What are they?
- Integers: ...., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,.....
- Absolute Value: |x| is the distance from 0 (always non negative).
- Opposite/addictive inverse: the number that sums to 0 with x (eg. opposite of 7 is -7)

Addition and Subtraction:
-Same sign: add magnitudes, keep the sign (eg. -6 + -4 = -10).
- Different signs: subtract magnitudes, take the sign of the larger magnitude (eg. -12 + 7 = -5)
- Substraction is "add the opposite": a - b = a + (-b) (eg. 18 -(-5) = 18 + 5).


Multiplication and Division (sign rules):
- (+) x (+) = (+)
- (-) x (-) = (+)
- (+) x (-) = (-)
- (-) x (+) = (-)

Order of Operations:
- Parentheses -> Exponents -> Multiple/Divide -> Add/Subtract (left to right)
- PEMDAS
- Keep parentheses around negatives when substituting.
