# PEMDDAS notes and breakdown

The Rule:

p - Parenthesis (and other grouping symbols)
e - Exponents(powers,roots)
m/d - Multiplication and Division (left to right)
a/s - Addition and Subtraction (left to right)
Mulitiplication/division are equal priority, so do them left to right. Same with addition and subtraction.

Negative Numbers:
This is where most people slip up:
(-3)^2 = (-3)(-3) = 9
-3^2 = -(3 x 3) = -9
Parentheses around the negative makes all the difference.

Distribution and signs:
-(x - 5) = -x + 5
Always apply negative to everything inside.
