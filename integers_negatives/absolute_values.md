# Absolute Values Questions and Excersies:

Defnition: Absolute value = deistance from 0 on the number line.
- Always non negative.

Key Rules:
|-7| = 7
|5| = 5
|0| = 0 

Operations Inside:
- Simplify inside first then take absolute vlaue.
- Example: |3 - 9| = |-6| = 6
- Reason is cause we first solve the 3 - 9 like regular integers, and then we figure out the absolute value.

Negative Outside:
- If a minus sign is outside absolute value, it does not flip.
- Example: -|-11| = -(11) = -11
- The absolute value makes it positive 11 and then the negative stays to remain negative 11.
