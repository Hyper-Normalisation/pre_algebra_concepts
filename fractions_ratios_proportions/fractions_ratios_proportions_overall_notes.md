# Fractions, Ratios, and Proportions Breakdown Notes:


1. Fraction Basics:
- A fraction represents part of a whole.
- A fraction is written as: a/b
     - a = numerator
     - b = denominator
- Example: 3/4 means 3 parts out of a total of 4 equal parts.


2. Simplifying Fractions:
- Reduce by dividing top and bottom (numerator and denominator) by there GCF (greatest common factor).
- Example: 18/24 -> Divide top and bottom by 6, which equals -> 3/4
- Equivlent Fractions:
  - 1/2 = 2/4 = 50/100



3. Improper Fractions and Mixed Numbers
- Proper Fraction = Numerator < Denominator
- Imporper Fraction = Numerator > Denominator
- Mixed Number = Whole Number + fraction
- Convert Improper -> mixed by dividing numberator by denominator


4. Operators With Fractions:

- Addition and Subtraction
	- Need common denominator, LCD (Least Common Denominator).
	- Example: 1/4 + 1/6
	  - LCD = 12 -> So we multiple the top and bottom of each fraction with the correct number to reach 12 as a common denominator.
 	- 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12
 
 - Multiplication
 	- Multiplcation is easy, multiple just straight across.
	- Example: (2/3) * (4/5) = 8/15

- Division:
	 - Multiple by the reciprocial
	 - Example: (3/4) / (2/5) = (3/4) * (5/2) =  15/8



5. Fractions Decimals and Percents:
- Convert Fraction to Decimal - By dividing numerator by denominator
- Convert Decimal to Percent - By Multiplying by 100
- Example: 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%


6. Ratios:
- A ratio compares two numbers.
- Written as: a:b or a/b
- Exmaple: 6:8 = 3:4
- Example above means that for every 3 of 1 thing, there are 4 of another ratio.



7. Proportions:
- A proportion is two equal ratios.
- Written as: a/b = c/d
- Solve by cross multiplying: a*d = b*c
- Example: 2/5 = x/20
	- 2*20 = 5x → 40 = 5x → x = 8.




Additional Notes:

- Greatest Common Factor:
- Definition: Largest number that divides evenly into both numbers.

Method 1: Listing Factors:
- Example: GCF of 18 and 24
	- Factors of 18 = 1,2,3,6,9,18
	- Factors of 24 = 1,2,3,4,,6,8,12,24\
	- Common Factors: 1,2,3,6 -> GCF = 6

Method 2: Prime Factorization:
- Break each number into primes:
	-18 = 2 x 3 x 3
	- 24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3
	- Take common primes: 2 x 3 = 6



- Least Common Denominator:

Method 1: Listing Multiples:
	- Examples: LCD of 4 and 6
		- Multiples of 4 = 4,8,12,16,20....
		- Multiples of 6 = 6,12,18,24....
		- Smallest common multiple = 12 -> LCD = 12

Method 2: Using Prime Factorization:
	- Denominators: 4 and 6
		- 4 = 2x2
		- 6 = 2x3
		- Take all prime factors at their highest power:
			- 2^2 x 3 = 12 -> LCD = 12



Quick Tricks to Remember:
GCF -> What can I divide top and bottom by?
LCD -> What number do both denominators fit into?
