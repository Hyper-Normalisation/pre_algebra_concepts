# Exponenets and Roots Overall Notes and Breakdown

Exponents: Powers
- An exponent tells you how manny times to multiple a number (the base) by iteslf.
- a^n = multiply itself by "n" times.
- Example: 2^4 = 16


Laws of Exponents:

1. Product Rule: a^m x a^n = a^m + n
- Add exponenets when multiplying like bases.

2. Quotient Rule: a^m / a^n = a^m - n (Divide is subtract the powers.)
- Subtract exponents when dividing like bases.

3. Power of a Power: (a^m)^n = a^m x n
- Multiple exponents when raising another power to another power.

4. Power of a Product: (ab)^n = a ^n x b^n
- Distribute the power to each factor.

5. Power of Quotent: (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n 
-  Distribute the exponent to numerator and denominator.

Special Exponents:
- Anything raised to the "0" is 1. 
- Negative exponenet means take the reciprical.


Roots and Radicals:
- A square root is asking: "What number squared is giving me this value."
- A cube root is asking: "What number cubed is giving me this value."


Rational Exponents:
- Roots can be written as fractional exponents.


Scientific Notation:
- A way to write very long numbers.
