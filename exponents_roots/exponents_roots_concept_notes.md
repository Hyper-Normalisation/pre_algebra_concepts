# Exponenets and Roots Overall Notes and Breakdown

Exponents: Powers

- a^n = multiply itself by "n" times.
- Example: 2^4 = 16


Laws of Exponents:
1. Product Rule: a^m x a^n = a^m + n (Multiply is add the powers.)
2. Quotient Rule: a^m / a^n = a^m - n (Divide is subtract the powers.)
3. Power of a Power: (a^m)^n = a^m x n
4. Power of a Product: (ab)^n = a ^n x b^n
5. Power of Quotent: (a/b)^n = a^n / b^n
